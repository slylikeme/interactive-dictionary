# interactive-dictionary
Simple interactive dictionary that calls on a .json file to return definitions of entered words.

User launches program which will run in a command line.

User enters a word and the dictionary returns the definition/s of that word.

If the word is not in the dictionary and is reasonably close to a word that is, the program will suggest that word to the user.

User can select whether they meant that word or not.

If so, that word will be returned to them, otherwise they will be informed that word is not in the dictionary.

Program runs in a while loop until user enters: "please quit"
